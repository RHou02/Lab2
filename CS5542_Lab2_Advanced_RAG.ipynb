For hybrid retrieval, I tried different α values (0.2, 0.5, 0.8) to balance keyword-heavy versus semantic-heavy results, and selected the α that gave the most relevant top chunks. Reranking with the cross-encoder then improved the ordering of evidence, usually placing the most precise chunks at the top, which increased Precision@K but required extra computation."
